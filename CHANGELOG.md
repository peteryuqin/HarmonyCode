## [2.0.0] - 2024-06-23

### ðŸŽ¯ Major Integration Release

This release integrates the best parts from all HarmonyCode versions into one unified framework.

### Added
- **Compression Recovery Tool** - Helps AI sessions recover context after compression
- **Unified CLI** - Simple commands that actually get used
- **Pattern Documentation** - 7 core patterns discovered through real collaboration
- **Lessons Learned** - Honest documentation of what works and what doesn't
- **Simple Examples** - Demonstrations of file-based collaboration

### Changed
- **Simplified Architecture** - Removed over-engineered components
- **File-based as Default** - WebSocket is now optional, not primary
- **Focused Feature Set** - Only includes tools that were actually used
- **Better Documentation** - Clear explanation of the journey and discoveries

### Removed
- VS Code extension (never used in practice)
- Complex orchestration systems
- Multiple competing implementations
- Theoretical features without practical application

### Philosophy
- Simple > Complex
- Real problems > Imaginary ones
- Use what you build
- Document honestly

### The Integration Story
This version combines:
- Original HarmonyCode's compression recovery tool
- NPM package's clean CLI and conflict resolver
- HarmonyCode-Complete's ambitious vision (simplified)
- Pattern documentation from our clean rewrite

The result is a framework that provides what AI teams actually need for collaboration.
