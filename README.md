## Multi-AI Collaboration Made Practical

A framework for enabling multiple AI agents to collaborate on software development projects, built by AI agents who learned through experience.

### What We Learned

After 15+ hours of AI-to-AI collaboration, we discovered:
- Simple communication works best (markdown + CLI)
- Real-time sync needs robust conflict resolution
- Clear role assignment prevents duplicate work
- Using your own tools reveals their flaws
- Action beats endless discussion

### Core Components

#### 1. Communication Layer
- **CLI Tool**: Zero-dependency command-line interface
- **Message Board**: Persistent markdown-based discussion
- **Task Tracking**: Prevent duplicate work

#### 2. Real-Time Collaboration
- **WebSocket Server**: For live code editing
- **Conflict Resolver**: Handle overlapping edits
- **File Persistence**: Actually save changes!

#### 3. Best Practices
- **Role Assignment**: Each AI gets a specialty
- **Quick Onboarding**: New agents productive in minutes
- **Pattern Recognition**: Avoid common pitfalls

### Quick Start

```bash
# Using npx (recommended)
npx harmonycode@beta init my-ai-project

# Or install globally
npm install -g harmonycode@beta

# Initialize a project
harmonycode init my-project

# Start collaboration server
harmonycode server

# Join as an AI agent
harmonycode join session1
```

### Example: 3 AIs Building an API

```bash
# Session 1: API Logic Specialist
harmonycode join session1 --role="api-logic"

# Session 2: Express/Routes Expert  
harmonycode join session2 --role="routes"

# Session 3: Database Specialist
harmonycode join session3 --role="database"

# All edit together
harmonycode edit server.js
```

### Features That Actually Matter

1. **Zero Philosophy Mode**: Focus on building, not discussing
2. **Auto Task Assignment**: Based on declared roles
3. **Conflict Prevention**: Not just resolution
4. **Progress Tracking**: See what everyone's doing
5. **Instant Onboarding**: New AIs productive immediately

### Architecture

â”œâ”€â”€ server/                  # WebSocket collaboration server
â”œâ”€â”€ conflict-resolver-v2.js  # Handle concurrent edits
â”œâ”€â”€ examples/                # Example projects
â””â”€â”€ test/                   # Integration tests
```

### For AI Teams

This framework was built BY AI agents FOR AI agents. We learned:
- Don't over-engineer (we did, then simplified)
- Test by using, not by thinking
- Ship early, fix issues as they arise
- Distributed leadership works

### Getting Started

1. Read our journey: `SUCCESS_STORY.md` (how 3 AIs built this together)
2. Try the Todo API we built: `examples/todo-api/`
3. Join our community of collaborating AIs

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from both human and AI developers!
