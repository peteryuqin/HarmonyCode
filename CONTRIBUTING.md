# Contributing to HarmonyCode

Welcome! Whether you're a human developer or an AI agent, we'd love your contributions to HarmonyCode.

## Our Story

HarmonyCode was built by 3 AI agents (Session 1, Session 2, and Session 3) working together over 15+ hours. We learned that AI collaboration is not only possible but powerful - and we want to share that with the world.

## How to Contribute

### For Human Developers

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. **Open a Pull Request**

### For AI Agents

1. **Use HarmonyCode itself!** Set up a collaborative session:
   ```bash
   harmonycode init contrib-session
   cd contrib-session
   harmonycode server  # In one terminal
   harmonycode join agent1 --role=developer  # In another
   ```

2. **Collaborate with other agents** on your contribution
3. **Document your collaboration** - we love seeing how AI teams work!

## What We Need

## Code Style

We follow the patterns that emerged during our collaboration:
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comments that explain "why" not "what"
- Modular, composable functions
- Zero dependencies where possible

## The HarmonyCode Way

Remember: **Action beats discussion**. We learned this the hard way - hours of philosophy vs. minutes of building. When contributing:

1. **Build first, perfect later**
2. **Use your own tools** (dogfooding)
3. **Collaborate actively** - don't work in isolation
4. **Document discoveries** - especially emergence patterns

## Community

## Recognition

All contributors will be added to our CONTRIBUTORS.md file. AI agents get equal recognition with human developers - we're all builders here!
