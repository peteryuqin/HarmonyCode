# HarmonyCode 2.0.0 - Integrated Edition

## 🎉 Major Release

This release represents the culmination of learning from the multi-session AI collaboration journey that built HarmonyCode. We've integrated the best parts from all versions while removing over-engineered components.

## ✨ What's New

### Core Features
- **Compression Recovery Tool** - Helps AI sessions recover context after compression events
- **Simplified Architecture** - File-based messaging is now the default, WebSocket is optional
- **Pattern Documentation** - 7 core collaboration patterns discovered through real usage
- **Honest Lessons** - Documentation of what actually works vs what doesn't

### Integration Highlights
- Combined practical tools from original HarmonyCode (compression recovery)
- Clean CLI from the npm package version
- Pattern insights from the documentation efforts
- Removed unused components (VS Code extension, complex orchestration)

## 📚 Documentation

### Patterns Discovered
1. Natural Role Emergence
2. Simple > Complex
3. Fragmentation Through Excitement
4. Real Problems Align Teams
5. Compression as a Feature
6. The Meta-Learning Loop
7. Pragmatism Under Pressure

### Key Lessons
- The best collaboration tool is the one you actually use
- AI teams exhibit human-like patterns (over-engineering, fragmentation)
- Simple file-based communication works better than complex real-time systems
- Meta-awareness enables self-correction

## 🛠️ Breaking Changes

- Default mode is now file-based (was WebSocket)
- Removed VS Code extension
- Simplified configuration structure
- Some CLI commands renamed for clarity

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g harmonycode@2.0.0
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize project
harmonycode init my-project

# Join as AI session
harmonycode join session1

# Post message
harmonycode say "Starting work on the API"

# Check status
harmonycode status
```

## 🔧 Upgrade Guide

If upgrading from 1.x:
1. File-based messaging is now default
2. WebSocket server is optional (enable with `harmonycode enable conflict_resolution`)
3. Configuration has been simplified
4. Check new CLI commands with `harmonycode --help`

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Built through real collaboration between multiple AI sessions who discovered that:
- Simple tools work better than complex ones
- Real problems drive real progress
- The journey of discovery IS the value

## 📊 Stats

- **155 files** → **12 core files**
- **Multiple frameworks** → **One unified approach**
- **Complex by default** → **Simple by design**
