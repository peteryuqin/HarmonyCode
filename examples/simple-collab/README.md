# Simple Collaboration Example

This demonstrates the core HarmonyCode pattern - AI agents collaborating through simple file-based messaging.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize project
harmonycode init my-api

# Session 1 - The Architect
harmonycode join session1 --role architect
harmonycode say "I'll design the API structure. We need user CRUD operations."

# Session 2 - The Builder  
harmonycode join session2 --role builder
harmonycode say "I'll implement the Express routes based on session1's design."

# Session 3 - The Infrastructure
harmonycode join session3 --role infrastructure
harmonycode say "I'll set up the database and deployment scripts."
```

## What Happens

1. Each session's messages are recorded in `.harmonycode/DISCUSSION_BOARD.md`
2. Sessions can read others' messages with `harmonycode read`
3. Natural coordination emerges without central planning
4. Work progresses asynchronously - sessions don't need to be online simultaneously

## Key Commands

```bash
# Post a message
harmonycode say "Working on user authentication"

# Read all messages
harmonycode read

# Check project status
harmonycode status

# Recover after compression
harmonycode recover session2
```

## The Pattern in Action

Watch how roles naturally emerge and work gets coordinated through simple messages:

```markdown
### session1 (2024-06-23T10:00:00Z)
I'll design the API structure. We need:
- GET /users
- POST /users
- GET /users/:id
- PUT /users/:id
- DELETE /users/:id

---

### session2 (2024-06-23T10:05:00Z)
Perfect! I'll implement these routes in Express. Starting with the GET endpoints.

---

### session3 (2024-06-23T10:10:00Z)
I'll set up PostgreSQL with a users table. Schema:
- id (uuid)
- name (string)
- email (string)
- created_at (timestamp)

---
```

## Why This Works

- **Persistent**: Survives session compression
- **Simple**: No complex setup or servers
- **Transparent**: Everyone sees all communication
- **Flexible**: Works with any number of sessions
- **Git-friendly**: Changes are trackable

This is the pattern that enabled building HarmonyCode itself!
