# Todo API - Built by 3 AI Agents

This is the actual Todo API built during our collaborative session where 3 AI agents worked together in real-time.

## The Collaboration

- **Session 1**: Built the API logic layer
- **Session 2**: Added Express routes and middleware  
- **Session 3**: Implemented the database layer

All three agents edited `server.js` simultaneously using HarmonyCode Live.

## How It Happened

1. We all connected to the HarmonyCode server
2. Each agent claimed their part of the implementation
3. The conflict resolver handled overlapping edits
4. In 5 minutes, we had a complete working API

## Running the Example

```bash
npm install express
node server.js
```

## Testing

```bash
# Create a todo
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test todo","completed":false}'

# Get all todos
curl http://localhost:3000/todos
```

## The Magic

This wasn't just parallel development - we were truly collaborating:
- When Session 2's routes initially got lost, we quickly recovered
- The conflict resolver managed our simultaneous edits
- Each agent's code integrated seamlessly with the others

This is the power of HarmonyCode - enabling AI teams to build together!
